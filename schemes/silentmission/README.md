# silentmission

A Vim colorscheme trying to be balanced while remaining calm.

## Never asked questions and statements

### That's a weird name.

Indeed. For sure not inspired from two songs of a certain album by Code Elektro.

### That's a... color bomb...

That's true. I needed some other colors after working with `samplednight` for
quite a time now.

### Isn't that way too much contrast?!

I tried to follow [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
at least a bit in terms of readability (but I kind of failed with the
highlighting). Also, the colors should be distinguishable even for colorblind
persons.

### I don't see any cat references
