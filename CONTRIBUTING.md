# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute here!

Then, there's probably not much to do pull-request-wise here. These
colorschemes are mine and I develop them on my own with my own thoughts,
though if you want to fix something on an existing colorscheme, consider
opening an issue first. Maybe we can get it sorted out in another way.

Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any installation issues, think that
a colorscheme could be more colorblind-safe or could be enhanced otherwise.
